# SQL on https://leetcode.com

The leetcode SQL questions are meant to help give you additional practice. My hope is that you will do <a href="https://leetcode.com/problem-list/m299an6d/">all the 45 questions</a> that are free for SQL on leetcode to gain confidence and understanding of how to use SQL techniques by practicing them. Reading the book, doing a few exercises in the labs is really not going to build the permanent learning that you want. Revisiting and practicing leetcode (or better yet a side project) will help a lot that way.



You can ask GPT for help if you get stuck and look at others solutions for the leetcode assignments. You do want to eventually learn the stuff, so please do try and practice until you can solve "easy" questions and some "mediums" questions. You can learn lots going through the hard questions as well.
